# Users can artificially increase their rewards

## Summary
Users can artificially increase their rewards
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon supplying or borrowing using the NFT position manager, users can be staked rewards based on the amount they have supplied or borrowed. This allows users to do 1 of those 2 things:
1. Supply tokens, then borrow from themselves and continuously repeat that
2. Borrow tokens, then supply those tokens and borrow again, rinse and repeat

Both of those actions will allow them to have a huge amount of rewards to be distributed to them due to those functions called upon supplying and borrowing:
```solidity
  function _handleSupplies(address pool, address asset, uint256 tokenId, uint256 balance) internal {
    bytes32 _assetHash = assetHash(pool, asset, false);
    uint256 _currentBalance = _balances[tokenId][_assetHash];

    _updateReward(tokenId, _assetHash);

    _balances[tokenId][_assetHash] = balance;
    _totalSupply[_assetHash] = _totalSupply[_assetHash] - _currentBalance + balance;
  }

  function _handleDebt(address pool, address asset, uint256 tokenId, uint256 balance) internal {
    bytes32 _assetHash = assetHash(pool, asset, true);
    uint256 _currentBalance = _balances[tokenId][_assetHash];

    _updateReward(tokenId, _assetHash);

    _balances[tokenId][_assetHash] = balance;
    _totalSupply[_assetHash] = _totalSupply[_assetHash] - _currentBalance + balance;
  }
```
